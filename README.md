## üìù Explanation of Code Files

### üìù `Form.php` File

#### Document Type Declaration
`<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that this document is an HTML5 document.

#### HTML Tag
`<html lang="en">` indicates the start of the HTML document and specifies the language as English.

#### Head Section
- `<head>` contains meta-information about the document.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets the character encoding to UTF-8, allowing for a wide range of characters.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` makes the web page responsive, adjusting its layout based on the device's width.
- `<title>Simple Form</title>` sets the title of the document that appears in the browser tab.

#### Body Section
- `<body>` contains the visible content of the web page.
- `<h3>Submit Your Information</h3>` is a heading for the form.
- `<form action="insert.php" method="post">` defines the form. The `action` attribute specifies where to send the form data upon submission, and `method="post"` indicates that the data should be sent using the POST method.

#### Form Elements
- Each `<label>` element is associated with an `<input>` element via the `for` attribute, which improves accessibility.
- `<input>` elements of type "text" and "email" gather user input. The `required` attribute ensures that the user must fill these fields before submitting the form.
- The final `<input>` is a submit button that sends the form data.

### üìù `Insert.php` File

#### PHP MySQL Insert Example

This document provides an overview of a PHP script that connects to a MySQL database, retrieves form data, and inserts it into a specific table.

#### Code Example:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost"; // Your server name
$username = "root";         // Your database username (e.g., "root" for XAMPP)
$password = "";             // Your database password (usually empty for XAMPP)
$dbname = "logininfo";      // Your database name
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
$name = $_POST['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$class = $_POST['class'];
$sql = "INSERT INTO student_info (name, email, section) VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$class')";
if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
    echo "New record created successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . mysqli_error($conn);
}
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
